# SteeringBox
Steering box for online racing to use with SimHub

This has been a fun project for me. I used a few amazing projects and combined them all into one super steering box that can be used with almost any 70mm steering wheel. Bolt it onto this 3D-printed project and have a good time. This began as a way to mount a SimPush Thrustmaster Wheel onto a universal button box with a quick release from AliExpress. I had to do some funky rotations on a Thrustmaster quick release base (rotated 30Â°) to make it work. I've included those 3D files in this project in case someone does want to use them. In the end though, I bought a standard 70mm rim and that works so much better. I use an NRG quick release to match up with my Simagic GT Neo to swap back and forth and it's been an incredible solution for me.
